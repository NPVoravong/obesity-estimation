In addition to our classification of the obesity level, we also attempted to use the data to predict weight.

This regression problem ultimately was not the most successful.

We attempted to fit two models since we were of differing opinions of whether or not all the features would be impactful.
We used two linear models in our approach: Ridge and Lasso models, where Ridge is more suited to data where there are many
impactful features and Lasso is more suited to data where few features should be impactful.

Looking at residual plots as well as the mean squared error and r2 values for our two models shows that neither of them are 
great fits. We arrive at the conclusion that perhaps our data is not suited for regression, and (maybe) more numerical data
involving health (like blood pressure) would be needed.
